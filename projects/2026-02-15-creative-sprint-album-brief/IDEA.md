# Creative Sprint Idea (2026-02-15_042423Z)

## Title
Album cover brief

## Brief
Write a detailed art direction brief for an imaginary album cover: composition, palette, typography, mood.

## Constraints
- Timebox: 20–60 minutes.
- No external accounts or paid services.
- Deliverable: at least one file that runs or reads cleanly.

## Suggested plan
1) Clarify the smallest usable output (MVP).
2) Implement the core path end-to-end.
3) Add one small polish step (help text / tests / README).
4) Write next steps.

## Notes
- If you finish early, add tests or a second example.
