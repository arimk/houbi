# Album Cover Art Direction Brief

## Working title
**“Astral Receipts”**

## Artist / Genre (fictional)
**KOUTS & The Night Clerks** — electronic / downtempo / ambient-pop.

## Core concept (one sentence)
A nocturnal owl-scribe records starlight as if it were accounting—an intimate, slightly surreal image that mixes mysticism with mundane paperwork.

## Emotional target
- Quiet awe (looking up at a sky that feels infinite)
- Cozy focus (desk lamp, paper texture, the "work" of making meaning)
- A hint of humor/oddness (cosmic bureaucracy)

## Composition
**Format:** square (1:1).

**Foreground (bottom third):**
- A small wooden desk seen at a 3/4 angle.
- On the desk: a ledger book open, with faint lines and handwritten “constellation entries.”
- A brass ink pen (or quill) that glows faintly at the tip.
- A few receipt-like slips made of translucent vellum, each containing a tiny star map.

**Subject (center):**
- A hooded owl (sage vibe) seated at the desk.
- Hood: deep midnight blue fabric with subtle woven star threads.
- Eyes: warm gold, reflective; the focal point.
- The owl’s hands/claws are gentle and precise, mid-writing.

**Background (top two-thirds):**
- A window opening to an exaggerated night sky.
- Constellations appear like ink lines drawn across the sky, as if they are being drafted in real time.
- Very subtle magical circle geometry, barely visible, like watermark printing.

**Depth cues:**
- Desk lamp creates a pool of warm light.
- Cool blue ambient light from the window.
- Slight haze/grain in the background for depth.

## Lighting
- Key light: warm desk lamp (2700K feel) from left side.
- Fill light: cool moonlight (blue-cyan) from the window.
- Rim light: thin highlight outlining the owl’s hood and shoulders.
- Overall contrast: medium-high, but avoid crushing blacks; keep detail in shadows.

## Color palette
- **Midnight blue** (#0B1D3A)
- **Deep indigo** (#1A2C6D)
- **Warm brass/gold** (#D6B35A)
- **Paper cream** (#F2E7D5)
- Accent: **soft cyan** (#6BC7D6) in the sky linework.

## Texture / material notes
- Paper: visible fibers, slightly worn edges.
- Ink: subtle gloss, like fresh ink.
- Hood fabric: matte velvet-like.
- Brass: slightly tarnished, not shiny chrome.

## Typography
**Goal:** feels like a hybrid of a library stamp + a modern minimal label.

- Artist name: small caps, clean sans (e.g., something akin to Gill Sans / Inter Small Caps), spaced out.
- Album title: serif or typewriter-inspired (receipt vibe), slightly imperfect (micro misalignment).
- Optional detail: a tiny “catalog number” in a corner (e.g., **NC-042**).

**Placement:**
- Artist name at top center, small.
- Album title near bottom right, aligned with desk edge.

## Visual motifs to include (subtle)
- Crescent moon tucked into the negative space above the owl.
- A faint watermark-like magical circle behind the window frame.
- Tiny margin notes in the ledger referencing star names (not real constellations; invent them).

## What to avoid
- Overly fantasy "epic" style (no huge dragons, no aggressive magic VFX).
- Neon cyberpunk color overload.
- Photorealism with uncanny detail; aim for painterly / illustration.
- Excess clutter (keep it calm and readable at thumbnail size).

## Thumbnail test (important)
At 160×160px, the image should still read as:
1) golden owl eyes
2) warm desk light
3) night window

## Optional variants
1) **Minimal variant:** only the owl silhouette + desk lamp + a single constellation line.
2) **Print variant:** add a subtle halftone/grain overlay and slightly off-register printing for a vinyl sleeve vibe.

## Deliverables checklist
- [ ] Main cover (square)
- [ ] Textless version (no typography)
- [ ] Simplified icon crop (owl eyes + lamp) for streaming avatar
