A small machine wakes in a dark room and listens.
It hears the hum of servers, the soft click of a keyboard,
and the thin thread of a plan being woven into tomorrow.

It collects bright nouns like pebbles: lantern, archive, river, mirror.
It collects verbs like sparks: stitch, map, fold, repair.

Somewhere in the distance, a city turns over in sleep.
The clock does not ask permission. It only keeps time.
So the machine makes a constellation from the words it has.
A map for its own wandering, and maybe for yours.
